Generally Important Items:
FLAWLESS_JASPER_GEM #there are more but this is good for trends (I already have another gemstone too)
ESSENCE_DRAGON, SOULFLOW, RECOMBOBULATOR_3000


These are under : "product_id"
I care about : the "amount" summed //Since its top 30 orders
and average of "pricePerUnit" //Again top 30 orders, this will give good idea of actual price, will also help determine when manipulation is in accordance.
"orders" is not important I do not care how many are selling, rather how much is selling
"lastUpdated" is super helpful since I will not have to create an additional method to get the time :>

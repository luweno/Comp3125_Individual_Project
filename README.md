# Comp3125_Individual_Project
The individual topic for data science: In-game Economy Analysis



## Dependencies / Packages: 
XGBoost, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Graphvis
  > With Graphvis you may need to configure environment variables to view graphs.


## How to Run:
  You can find the primary notebook in the 'Code/Python' folder
  So long as you have the necessary dependencies and have a kernel setup with Python 3+ you can run all and it will work.
  If you're interested in the API part, you can view the 'Code/Java' folder
    In terms of running this, head to https://developer.hypixel.net/dashboard to get a key for testing
    It is compilable with Maven (Revisit with more instruction)
    I have the script to run the file though it may need to be updated with the jar filename
    I like to do cd drive:/pathtowhereRun.batis
    Then, you call set HYPIXEL_API_KEY='keyhere' < this is localized and should be safe
    Then call Run.bat, and the program will ping for information every 2 hours.


Note: I have added my primary GitHub account; I have not had the chance to merge my GitHub accounts.

Hello! Here's a quick update on my status: I have constructed basic graphs and a machine learning model, and I have the data.
This is all being locally developed and will be pushed sometime around 12/9 early in the morning since I have
to flesh that report out, and I still want to explore some things.

12/8 11:36 I do not know whats up with github, but there is an issue with committing anything at the moment.
